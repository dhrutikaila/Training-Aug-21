          <h1>Hoisting</h1>
          <p>
            JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter
            allocates memory for variable and function declarations prior to
            execution of the code. Declarations that are made using var are
            initialized with a default value of undefined. Declarations made
            using let and const are not initialized as part of hoisting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conceptually hoisting is often presented as the interpreter
            "splitting variable declaration and initialization, and moving
            (just) the declarations to the top of the code". This allows
            variables to appear in code before they are defined. Note however,
            that any variable initialization in the original code will not
            happen until the line of code is executed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5>Only Declarations are hoisted</h5>
             JavaScript only hoists declarations,
            not initializations. If a variable is used in code and then declared
            and initialized, the value when it is used will be its default
            initialization (undefined for a variable declared using var,
            otherwise uninitialized).
          </p>
          <p>
              <h5>Let and const hoisting</h5>
              Variables declared with let and const are also hoisted, but unlike for var the variables are not initialized with a default value of undefined. Until the line in which they are initialized is executed, any code that accesses these variables will throw an exception.
          </p>

          <h3>code</h3>
          <p>
            catName("Chloe");
            <br />
            function catName(name) {
            <br />
            <span class="ms-3">console.log("My cat's name is " + name);</span>
            <br />} <br />
            /* The result of the code above is: "My cat's name is Chloe" */
          </p>
          <p>Even though we call the function in our code first, before the function is written, the code still works, because this is how context execution works in JavaScript.</p>
