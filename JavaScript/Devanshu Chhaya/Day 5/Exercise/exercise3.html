<!-- Explain usage of Function Hosing using example -->
<!-- Hoisting is a JavaScript technique which moves variables and function declarations to the top of their scope before code execution begins.
    Within a scope no matter where functions or variables are declared, they're moved to the top of their scope.
    Note that hoisting only moves the declaration while assignments are left in place. -->
