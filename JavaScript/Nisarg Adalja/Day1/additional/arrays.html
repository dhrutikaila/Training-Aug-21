       // let text = "We are the so-called "Vikings " from the north.";
        /* The string will be chopped to "We are the so-called ".

        The solution to avoid this problem, is to use the backslash escape character.

        The backslash (\) escape character turns special characters into string characters:

        Code	Result	Description
        \'	       '	Single quote
        \"	       "	Double quote
        \\	       \	Backslash    */

        var text = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";
        console.log(text);

        /* Six other escape sequences are valid in JavaScript:

Code	Result
\b	    Backspace
\f	    Form Feed
\n	    New Line
\r	    Carriage Return
\t	    Horizontal Tabulator
\v	    Vertical Tabulator  */
    </script>
