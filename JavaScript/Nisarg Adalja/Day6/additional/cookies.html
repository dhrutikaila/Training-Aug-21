          /*What are Cookies?
        Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer.

        When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and the server forgets everything about the user.

        Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":

        When a user visits a web page, his/her name can be stored in a cookie.
        Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his/her name.
        Cookies are saved in name-value pairs like:

        username = John Doe
        
        When a browser requests a web page from a server, cookies belonging to the page are added to the request. This way the server gets the necessary data to "remember" information about users.
        None of the examples below will work if your browser has local cookies support turned off.

        Create a Cookie with JavaScript
        JavaScript can create, read, and delete cookies with the document.cookie property.
        With JavaScript, a cookie can be created like this:*/
        document.cookie = "name=John Doe";

        //You can also add an expiry date (in UTC time). By default, the cookie is deleted when the browser is closed:
       // document.cookie = "username=John Doe; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2021 12:00:00 UTC";

        //With a path parameter, you can tell the browser what path the cookie belongs to. By default, the cookie belongs to the current page.
       document.cookie = "name=John Doe; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2021 12:00:00 UTC; path=/";

        /*Read a Cookie with JavaScript
        With JavaScript, cookies can be read like this:*/

       // let x = document.cookie;

        /*Change a Cookie with JavaScript
        With JavaScript, you can change a cookie the same way as you create it:
        */
        document.cookie = "name=Nisarg Adalja; expires=Wed, 06 Oct 2021 12:00:00 UTC; path=/";

        /*Delete a Cookie with JavaScript
        Deleting a cookie is very simple.
        You don't have to specify a cookie value when you delete a cookie.
        Just set the expires parameter to a past date:*/

        document.cookie = "name=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";
