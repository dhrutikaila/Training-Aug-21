        /*Web Workers API

        A web worker is a JavaScript running in the background, without affecting the performance of the page.

        What is a Web Worker?
        When executing scripts in an HTML page, the page becomes unresponsive until the script is finished.

        A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.*/


        function startWorker() {
            if (typeof (w) == "undefined") {
                w = new Worker("demo_workers.js");
            }
            w.onmessage = function (event) {
                document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = event.data;
            };
        }

        function stopWorker() {
            w.terminate();
            w = undefined;
        }
