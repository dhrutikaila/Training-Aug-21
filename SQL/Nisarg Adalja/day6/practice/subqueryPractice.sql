/* A subquery is a query that is nested inside a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement, or inside another subquery.*/

/* A subquery can be used anywhere an expression is allowed. In this example a subquery is used as a column expression named MaxUnitPrice in a SELECT statement. */

/*
Correlated subqueries
Many queries can be evaluated by executing the subquery once and substituting the resulting value or values INTO the WHERE clause of the outer query. In queries that include a correlated subquery (also known as a repeating subquery), the subquery depends on the outer query for its values. This means that the subquery is executed repeatedly, once for each row that might be SELECTed by the outer query. This query retrieves one instance of each employee's first and last name for which the bonus in the SalesPerson TABLE is 5000 and for which the employee identification numbers match in the Employee and SalesPerson TABLEs.
