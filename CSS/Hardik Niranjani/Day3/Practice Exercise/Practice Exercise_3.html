        <p>In a bid to provide relief to stressed telecom sector, the Union Cabinet on Wednesday has
            approved
            moratorium on payment of spectrum dues by telcos, sources told News18. This will provide
            much-needed time
            to ailing telecom operators like Vodafone Idea that have to pay thousands of crores of rupees in
            unprovisioned
            past statutory dues.<br><br>

            Kumar Mangalam Birla, former chairman of Vodafone Idea Ltd, earlier wrote a letter to Cabinet
            Secretary
            offering
            his stake in Vodafone Idea to the government or any company approved by the government for free.
            On August
            4,
            billionaire Birla resigned as chairman of beleaguered Vodafone Idea Ltd.<br><br>

            VIL, which was created from the merger of British telecom giant Vodafone’s India unit and
            Birla’s Idea
            Cellular Ltd,
            has to pay about Rs 50,399.63 crore in statutory dues dating back over past many years.<br><br>

            Some within the government are, however, questioning using taxpayer money to bailout telcos who
            had failed
            to provision
            for statutory dues during the pendency of legal cases.</p>
