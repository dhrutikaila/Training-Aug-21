            <p>The history of independent India began when the country 
            became an independent nation within the British Commonwealth
            on 15 August 1947. Direct administration by the British, which
            began in 1858, affected a political and economic unification
            of the subcontinent. When British rule came to an end in 1947, the
            subcontinent was partitioned along religious lines into two separate
            countriesâ€”India, with a majority of Hindus, and Pakistan, with
            a majority of Muslims. Concurrently the Muslim-majority northwest and east
            of British India was separated into the Dominion of Pakistan, by the partition of India. 
            The partition led to a population transfer of more than 10 million people between India
            and Pakistan and the death of about one million people. Indian National Congress leader 
            Jawaharlal Nehru became the first Prime Minister of India, but the leader most associated
            with the independence struggle, Mahatma Gandhi, accepted no office. The Constitution 
            adopted in 1950 made India a democratic country, and this democracy has been sustained 
            since then. India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newly independent 
            states. The nation has faced religious violence, casteism, naxalism, terrorism and regional 
            separatist insurgencies. India has unresolved territorial disputes with China which in 1962 escalated 
            into the Sino-Indian War, and with Pakistan which resulted in wars in 1947, 1965, 1971 and 1999. 
            India was neutral in the Cold War, and was a leader in the Non-Aligned Movement. However, it made s loose 
            alliance with the Soviet Union from 1971, when Pakistan was allied to the United States and People's Republic 
            of China.
